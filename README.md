# KinetiForge-Vehicle-System
High-performance, modular vehicle physics system for Unreal Engine 5, fully implemented in C++ with real-time tunable parameters.

* Demonstration video:

‚ú® Key Features

  * High-Performance C++ Core ‚Äì Written from scratch, runs much faster than Blueprint-based systems, supports async physics with excellent stability

  * Full Blueprint Support ‚Äì All core functions are exposed to Blueprints, allowing you to build a complete custom drivetrain or extend features purely in Blueprints

  * Modular Architecture ‚Äì Multiple wheels, multiple drivetrains, even complex multi-body vehicles in a single Actor

  * Highly Configurable ‚Äì Almost every parameter can be adjusted at runtime; supports both static meshes and skeletal meshes (no skeleton binding required)

  * Physically-Driven Simulation

    - Tire forces based on force analysis, curve-tunable, supporting camber/toe effects, friction ellipse, combined slip

    - Suspension supports Telescopic Fork, MacPherson, double wishbone, trailing arm, with adjustable stiffness, damping, preload

    - Engine, clutch, gearbox, and differential are fully simulated with inertia, turbo, stall/reverse support, LSD

  * Driver Assistance Systems ‚Äì Automatic gearbox, traction control, ABS, rev-matching, auto clutch, turbo anti-lag, auto-hold

üöÄ Getting Started

  * Copy the plugin to your Unreal project‚Äôs Plugins/ folder

  * Enable Async Physics in Project Settings

  * Set your physics timestep to ‚â§ 1/60 sec (recommended: 1/120 sec)

  * Open the example map and start tuning your vehicles!

ü§ù Participation & Feedback
  * Everyone is welcome to raise questions, suggestions, or bug reports!
